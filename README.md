i have used the wikipedia API in my skils section, which highlights all the diffrent programming languages such as HTML and java.
in the skill section if a user clicks on any of the langauges then wikipedia will dispaly the first sentence of the first result. also there is a search box which allows you to search any other skills. as you can see below
