#### 1. Initial Designs (Wireframes)


#### 1. Initial Designs
My very first initial design was a hotel website. The hotel website advertising my hotel however, I found it hard to do as I did not have much time due to the other course which had to be completed along with this module.I then decided to make Blog website which is about myself. The blog webbsite is a multiple page website and it consists of Home, Education, Projects and Contact. 
#### development Process
I started developing the home page by getting the code for the navigation bar from the w3schools and modified it to my website. I kept on checking if the mobile responsive was working which it was. I decided to do a hoover image that changes from one picture to another with text coming on top when the curser is on it. Then I added a slideshow for my hobbie section on the home page and added a video on the dmu section. after that I started to create my education page. My education page, had radio button and skill progress bar and 3 images of my favourite code. On My project page, I had pfd images that has links to my work at the bottom i had wiki api. For my last page (contact) I had a simple form where people can write their information. after doing all of this the responsives did not work, not even for tablet view or mobile view. I went to dave and faina to see if they could sort my issue out as they could not I started again. 
The new layout (recent website) I changed the layout however kept most of the content. in the new one on the education page I added my wiki api instead of adding it on project page. this made sense to me to have it where my skills where. on my contact page I added a google api map where it shows where I am from (dmu). on each content I added I made sure it was mobile/tablet and desktop responsive which it was. 

#### Issue Solved
The issues I had on the recent website, was that on the home page mobile responsive, it was not as proper as it should have been this is due to my bitmoji image. I have solved this as I went on my css code and saw the name convection was different to the html name. this is why it didnt was responsive properly. I named the css one as the same as the html and when I play the website the mobile responsive on homepage didnt move and it was properly fitted. another issue I had was my footer on project page,it kept on showing on the top of the page instead of the bottom. when I moved the api section to education, my footer on project page went down where it susposed to be. anoother problem i had come across was that when i pushed my work through another group members name was showing as a contributor. i solved this by asking my peers for help and they told me how to rectify this situation.

#### 3. Intelligent application of Information Architecture and PARC

I have added a sitemap in my footer and this is on all of the pages so that it is easy for the user to navigate.

#### 4.Resposive design

I have used @media queries to make my website responsive on tablet view and desktop view. 

```css tablet view
@media screen and (min-width: 500px)
```

```css desktop view 
@media screen and (min-width: 1000px)
```

#### 6. API & JSON - Wikipedia
I have 2 apis, one is in my education page. this api is a wiki api where they search for any code denifition and also if they click on the skill name i.e. html a search automactically appears at the bottom of the page. another api I got is for contact page. here I used google api map. I choose this as it look better and it made sense on where people can find me.
